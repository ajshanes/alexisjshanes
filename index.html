          <p>Farmers, ranchers and agricultural workers, who live almost exclusively in rural areas, could be at higher risk for compensated mental health and suicide, according to the CDC.</p>

          <p>However, federal action against rural suicide could come this year in the form of the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018, better known as the farm bill.</p>

          <p>The farm bill, which funds U.S. Department of Agriculture programs, is up for renewal this year. The current edition, passed in 2014, expired Sept. 30.</p>

          <p>Congress, now in a lame-duck session approaching the end of the year, struck a deal in principle for an $867 billion farm bill Nov. 29. After months of contentious negotiations, legislators are finalizing the text ahead of a vote and the president’s signature.</p>

          <p>Among the most-watched additions to the farm bill this year are industrial hemp legalization and a potential cuts to the Supplemental Food and Nutrition Assistance Program (food stamps), but one rural health section could authorize millions of dollars for mental health resources for farmers and ranchers.</p>

          <p>The Senate’s current farm bill draft reauthorizes and funds a Farm and Ranch Stress Assistance Network with $10 million each fiscal year through 2023. It would provide grants to state departments of agriculture and cooperative extension services, along with non-profit organizations, to establish stress assistance programs. FRSAN first appeared in the 2008 farm bill but hasn’t received funding until now.</p>

          <p>These programs, according to the bill text, would include counseling, along with information about farm telephone and website helplines, mental health support training workshops, support groups and home delivery of assistance.</p>

          <p>FRSAN would require, within a year of its authorization, a report about the state of behavioral and mental health in farmers and ranchers — including “an evaluation of the impact of farmer and rancher suicides on the agricultural workforce, agricultural production, rural families and communities, and succession planning.”</p>

          <p>The current House draft also reauthorizes FRSAN, although it hasn’t yet put funding to the program.</p>

          <p>Rural areas saw a 19.74 percent suicide rate between 2013 and 2015, compared to a 12.72 rate for large metropolitan areas during the same time, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The rate is based on suicides as a percentage of total deaths and population.</p>

          <p>A more broad CDC study tracking suicides between 2001 and 2015 saw an increase in suicides regardless of county urbanization level, but the rise in rural areas well exceeded the national average.</p>

          <p>Illinois suicide data reflects national trends. Suicide rate overall is rising, although the state still ranks below the national average, and it’s higher in rural areas.</p>

          <p>The stressors in rural life and farming that sometimes lead to suicide are unique and misunderstood, said Ted Matthews, a psychologist who receives funding from the Minnesota Department of Agriculture and works almost exclusively with farmers.</p>

          <p>“Stress and anxiety, it gets people deeper and deeper,” Matthews said. “Oftentimes, with people who have suicidal ideation, they believe that the world would be better off without them, and that’s not true.”</p>

          <p>But Matthews is skeptical that federal action will solve mental health problems facing rural communities, especially those reliant on farming occupations, he said. Despite well-meaning intentions at the federal level, lack of accountability in practice means money won’t have maximum impact.</p>

          <p>“What I see governments doing, is they’ll say, ‘OK, we have $10 million in the farm bill for mental health,’” Matthews said. “But do they care how that’s spent? No. Do they care that it’s being used to make things better? Doesn’t look to me like they do.”</p>

          <p>As a result, local organizations don’t invest in hiring more staff or establishing relationships with local clergy or law enforcement, individuals Matthews said are important in combatting addressing mental health crises in rural areas. When funding doesn’t make a measurable difference, it sets future programs up for failure.</p>

          <p>Still, in rural areas, mental health care often is cost prohibitive, he added.</p>

          <p>“In cities, you can see a psychiatrist and actually work through issues with them,” Matthews said. “You go to rural areas, and the psychiatrists will see seven people an hour because they charge $1,500 an hour. In rural areas, the psychiatrist is for one thing — that’s for medication, for drugs.”</p>

          <p>Altering the approach at the local level, he said, is the key to improving mental health in local areas and, as a result, lowering instances of suicide.</p>

          <p>“One of the problems that we have in mental health and rural communities is people keep forgetting that mental health is not mental illness,” he said. “How many people do you know of who have seen a therapist and they’re mentally ill? They’re mentally healthy — they need to be healthier. Our focus is on getting better, healthier, finding ways to take a step forward.”</p>
